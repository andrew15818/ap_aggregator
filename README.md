# Terminal-based feed parser
The purpose of this app is to condense various feeds I usually parse into a single terminal application, 
mostly for my own convenience. 
This app is built on the [urwid](https://urwid.org/index.html) library for Python, which is a wrapper over the ncurses 
library for terminal applications in Linux.
